1. Add buttons for each sound to your html

2. Create an event listener that tracks a key press anywhere on the page
    - test by console logging a message

3. Use the event object to check what key you've pressed
    - console log the code value

4. Only run some code when you click on a specific key
    - console log a message only when you click the a key

5. Replace that console log with playing the sound file when the a key is clicked
    - you'll hear the sound play when the a key is clicked

6. Repeating that for the other sound files and assigning them a key to play the sound when clicked
    - should have a drum kit you can play on the keyboard

7. Add event listener to a single button
    - console log a message when that button is clicked

8. Replace the console log with playing a corresponding sound file
    - similar code to playing sound on key press

9. Repeat that process for the other buttons

// EXTRA STRETCH GOAL

10. Try to condense and refactor code
    - try to loop through buttons to add click event listeners to them
