1. Add content to you HTML e.g. Roll button, image for the dice, element to hold the player score, an
   element to display win/lose message, and a reset game button

2. Try and get a click event connected to the roll button
    - for now just console log something in the event so when you click you get a console log back

3. Instead try to generate a rndom number when you click the button between 1 - 6
    - you can console log this value for now when you click the button

4. Use that random number to add to a score variable and display that score to the screen

5. Display the correct dice image for the number you rolled e.g. if you roll a 3 then show the 3 face of 
    a dice

6. Track if a 1 is generated, if it is then reset the score to 0 and display a lose message

7. If the score gets to over 21 then display a win message

8. If the player wins or loses then display the reset game button

9. Add an event listener to the reset button
    - test this with a console log you should see when you click the button

10. Reset the game when the button is clicked e.g. reset score to 0, hide any win/lose messages, make sure 
    the roll button is visible etc.
